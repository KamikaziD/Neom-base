# NEOM 2.0

Next.js ships with [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) which provides an easy solution to build your own `API`. This example shows how to create multiple `API` endpoints with serverless functions, which can execute independently.

## Setup

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AO-Group/Neom-2.0.git
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose build
```
